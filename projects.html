    <h2>EEG / fMRI to Image Reconstruction</h2>
    <p>
        I investigate how visual information can be reconstructed from neural signals under severe information
        constraints. My work uses EEG and fMRI datasets (e.g., THINGS, NSD) and frames reconstruction as a
        probabilistic inference problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        I design diffusion-based generative pipelines to model uncertainty, noise, and information bottlenecks,
        and explore real-time EEG-to-image reconstruction under latency and robustness constraints.

    <h2>Perceptual Video Compression with Generative Models</h2>
    <p>
        During my Master’s research, I developed diffusion-based video compression models that predict future
        frames under constrained bitrates. The work focuses on perceptual fidelity rather than pixel accuracy,
        integrating multimodal conditioning such as optical flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project connects information theory, generative modeling, and human perception, studying how
        representational capacity is allocated across space and time.
