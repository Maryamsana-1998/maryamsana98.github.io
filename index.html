    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I am a computer science and machine learning researcher with a strong interest in understanding 
        human cognition and brain dynamics through computational modeling. My background is in deep generative models, 
        video understanding, and representation learning, with current work extending these methods to neural data analysis.
        I am particularly interested in the parallels between video modeling and brain dynamics—viewing fMRI as spatiotemporal data
         where distributed neural activity evolves over time. By leveraging ideas from information theory, 
         generative modeling, and representation learning, I aim to bridge machine learning and computational neuroscience. 
         
    </p>
    <p>
        My research focuses on understanding and reconstructing perceptual representations from constrained
        information sources, such as neural signals and compressed video. I have worked extensively with
        diffusion models, VAEs, and multimodal learning, applying information-theoretic perspectives to both
        artificial and biological systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the Psychcontrol Lab (UKGM Marburg), where I analyze
        EEG and fMRI data to study how visual information is encoded and reconstructed from neural activity.
        I have completed my Master’s degree and am currently seeking PhD opportunities at the intersection of AI, cognition, and brain science.
