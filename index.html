    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        I have completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science and am currently seeking PhD positions in
        machine learning and computational neuroscience. My background lies at the intersection of deep learning,
        generative modeling, and signal processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        My research focuses on understanding and reconstructing perceptual representations from constrained
        information sources, such as neural signals and compressed video. I have worked extensively with
        diffusion models, VAEs, and multimodal learning, applying information-theoretic perspectives to both
        artificial and biological systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the Psychcontrol Lab (UKGM Marburg), where I analyze
        EEG and fMRI data to study how visual information is encoded and reconstructed from neural activity.
        Previously, my Master’s research at Kyung Hee University focused on perceptual video compression using
        diffusion-based generative models.
